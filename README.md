# GC-Kakao-Material-Calculator

A material calculator used to calculate the resources needed to Soul Imprint Units in [Grand Chase Kakao](https://en.grandchase.net/pc/). 

Created as a way to practice using React.js for frontend development. 

Calculator features include:
- Styled dropdown list which highlights options currently selected and being hovered over
- Calculations for Soul Imprint 0 all the way to Soul Imprint 15, with core unlocks (Mind, Body & Soul at SI5, SI10, & SI15) included
